### Description

Eva theme is a semantic coloring code theme dedicated to making you more comfortable programming.

There are four styles in it: Dark, Dark Bold, Light, Light Bold. The Bold styles make keywords and function names thicker.

Requires a minimum of 1.12.0 VSCode version.

### Support

Tested with the following languages in native environment, except derived frameworks:

- HTML / XML / JSX / WXML
- CSS / LESS / SCSS / WXSS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- C / C++ / C#
- Java
- PHP
- Pyhton
- Golang
- Ruby
- Dart
- JSON
- Markdown

Other languages have syntax highlighting too, it's just not guaranteed to be semantic yet.

### Installing

Paste the following command into VSCode extension input and press `Enter`:

```shell
ext install eva-theme
```

### Activate

VSCode → Preferences → Color themes → Select Eva theme

### Conflicts

Some extensions add some of their own semantic coloring to cover the theme file, thereby changing the color of some characters. You can disable this feature by turning off C_Cpp.enhancedColorization in the settings. Currently found such extensions are [Babel JavasSript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel), [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode), [JavaScript Atom Grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar), [MS-C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).
